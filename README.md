# Bouncing Circles

This is a Python program using Pygame to simulate bouncing circles. The program includes various functionalities such as collision detection, particle effects, sound effects, color changing, and a checkbox to activate/deactivate collision between circles.


## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/bouncing-circles.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bouncing-circles
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Python script `bouncing_circles.py`:
```bash
python bouncing_circles.py
```

## Features

- **Bouncing Circles**: Two circles (blue and green) bounce around the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: Circles collide with each other and the outer red circle.
- **Color Changing**: Press 'B' to change the color of the blue circle and 'G' to change the color of the green circle.
- **Checkbox**: Activate or deactivate collision between the blue and green circles.
- **Particle Effects**: Particle effects are created upon collision.
- **Sound Effects**: Sound effect plays upon collision.
